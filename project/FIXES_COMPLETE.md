# All Fixes Applied - Complete Resolution

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Image Upload Functionality Fixed ✓

**Problem:** Product images, additional images, and brand logos were not uploading correctly.

**Root Cause:** The upload routes weren't properly extracting the `folder` parameter from form data with multipart/form-data.

**Solution:**
- Modified `/server/routes/uploadRoutes.js` to read folder from query parameters
- Updated `/sarvin/src/api/uploadAPI.js` to send folder as query parameter
- Fixed both single and multiple image upload endpoints
- Backend now properly returns `urls` array for multiple uploads

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes/uploadRoutes.js` - Fixed folder parameter extraction
- `sarvin/src/api/uploadAPI.js` - Updated to send folder as query param

### 2. Brands/Types Display with Logos Fixed ✓

**Problem:** Brands section only showed text initials instead of actual brand logos, and wasn't visible on homepage.

**Solution:**
- Updated `BrandsSection.jsx` to properly display brand logos when available
- Added fallback to text initials if logo fails to load or doesn't exist
- Integrated BrandsSection into HomePage
- Added `fetchTypes` dispatch to load brands on homepage
- Fixed component naming from `typesSection` to `BrandsSection`
- Updated heading from "Trusted types" to "Shop by Brand"
- Added proper image error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `sarvin/src/pages/HomePage/components/BrandsSection.jsx` - Complete rewrite with logo support
- `sarvin/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.jsx` - Added BrandsSection import and rendering

## System Architecture

### Image Upload Flow:
1. Frontend FormData with file → Query param for folder
2. Backend multer middleware processes file
3. Upload to S3 with unique key
4. Return CloudFront URL
5. Frontend stores URL in form state

### Brand Management:
1. Admin can create brands with logos
2. Brands displayed on homepage with logo images
3. Clicking brand filters products by that brand
4. Fallback to initial letter if no logo available
